    content: "Regular maintenance is essential for both tanked and tankless water heaters. For traditional tank water heaters, annual flushing prevents sediment buildup that reduces efficiency and shortens lifespan. Tankless units require periodic descaling to remove mineral deposits from the heat exchanger, especially in areas with hard water. Both systems benefit from professional inspection of venting, gas connections, and safety components to ensure optimal performance and safety."

    content: "Locate your main water shutoff at the street meter now, before an emergency occurs. It's typically located in your utility area, garage, or at the main water meter near the street. Mark it with a bright tag and ensure it's easily accessible. In an emergency, turn clockwise to shut off. Every household member should know its location and how to operate it."

    title: "Emergency Gas Shutoff",
    content: "Plumbers install gas systems from the meter to all appliances inside your home. From the meter inside, the system is the homeowner's responsibility, not the gas company's. If you smell gas, evacuate immediately, don't use electrical switches or phones inside, and call a licensed plumber from a safe location. Know that every gas appliance has its own shutoff valve, and there's a main gas shutoff valve at your meter. In an emergency, turn the main valve 90 degrees (quarter turn) using a wrench so it's perpendicular to the pipe. Only qualified professionals should turn gas back on. For any gas system issues or concerns, call a licensed plumber to investigate and fix the problem safely."

    title: "Seasonal Plumbing Tips",
